Produce a GitHub style summary for the current chat context, that is formatted to work with github markup (sections, bullets, clear headings). This should follow Github best practices for pull request summaries. I want to be able to copy in paste into Github and have it format correctly. Syntax can be found here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax. User can specify a particular section after the command which you will then focus on that particular part of the chat context. Put it in a code window that can be copied.
