## Which AAs to Get First

### Step-by-Step Order (Early Game, 100–500 AA)

1. **Touch of the Cursed** – 10–15 ranks first
2. **Mortal Coil** – 10–15 ranks second
3. **Ragged Bite of Chaos** – 10–15 ranks third; "free kill on a 1 minute cooldown"

### After Wizard Rebirth

4. **Kerafyrm's Prismatic Familiar** – Must get; follow all prerequisites listed on the ability
5. **Leeching Shield** and **Leeching Blade** – Makes survival trivial; "turn auto attack on and survive"
6. **Spell Casting Fury Mastery** – 1–5 ranks only; diminishing returns after that

### Defer Until ~1000 AA

- Theft of Life
- Soul Abrasion (may only affect SK tap self buff; unclear)
- Weapon Affinity
- Veteran Enhancement

### Alternative Early Options (Optional)

These have cooldowns and are less consistent, but help early:
- Viscous Bite of Chaos
- Ragged Bite
- Scourge Skin

## Rebirth Order (Consensus)

1. **Wizard** – First rebirth; familiar increases lifetap damage, 100% crit on procs, more crit damage
2. **Berserker** – Second rebirth; "really good paired with the SK tank stance"
3. **Cleric** – Fourth rebirth; "objectively best 4th due to Divina Avatar for bosses"

*Beastlord/Bloodlust was discussed but deemed unlikely to match Wizard's power boost.*

## Rebirth Mechanics

- Rebirth at ~500 AA drops you to ~125 AA
- You can still put points into any SK or rebirth-class AA after rebirth (no lockout)
- Save scrolls before rebirth to quickly regain AA
- Buy XP potion (~10k) before rebirth
- Most gear unequips; some low-level legendaries (e.g., lv5/lv10) may remain usable
- Lv50 buffs (including long SK buffs) persist through rebirth

---

## Leveling After Rebirth

- 1–25: Very fast with Kerafyrm familiar (~30 minutes)
- 1–50: ~3 hours with XP potion
- Route: Kunark → MMM at 26 → PoI at 45
- Avoid pulling 15+ mobs (they get a massive damage increase)

---

## Playstyle Notes

- **2H vs 1H+Shield:** Several prefer 2H around level 40+
- **Melee vs casting:** Early on, lifetaps needed for survival; with Leeching Shield/Blade and procs, mostly auto-attack
- **Farming:** Mount up (don't get pushed/interrupted), pull 20–30 mobs, auto-attack, press 1–2 for lifetaps, loot

## Tome of Respec

- Available if you need to reallocate AA for different content phases
