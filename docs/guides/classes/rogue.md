## Which AAs to Get First

### Step-by-Step Order

1. **Chaotic Backstab** – Required for Seized Opportunity
2. **Seized Opportunity** – Allows full frontal backstab
3. **Strikethrough** – Important for enrage; getting hit during enrage with only 6 points suggests more ranks help
4. **Proc AAs** – Procs are very strong; "unless I have assassins + feigned up procs are just so much stronger"
5. **Defensive focuses** (Improved Parry, Riposte, Dodge) – Incrementally help; Ward of Mysaphar + dodge gem biggest for VP; Hagi gives a lot naturally

### Notes

- **Etherium Blades** – Procs Blade Fury but very rare; may overlap with Hundred Hands from other sources
- **Anatomy** – Speccing out showed no noticeable difference; large backstabs likely from Massive Strike
- **Rake's Vengeance** (or similar) – Makes all rounds hit AoE for ~15 seconds; works with riposte disc/gem on 10 min CD; helps mass pulls

## Rebirth Order Options

### Proc Build (Consensus)

- **Rogue → Wizard** – Familiar makes all poisons/AA poisons crit; huge proc damage
- **Rogue → Wizard → Beastlord** – Flurry, Accuracy, double attack, damage scaling CDs, Bloodlust, poison/disease synergy, resist reduction
- **Rogue → Wizard → Beastlord → Shaman** – Empowered aggression, external procs; Rabid Bear helps variance during burn phases

### Rabid Bear (Beastlord)

- 5 min up, 6 min recast
- Overcap stats and attack help variance; "significantly closes the variance during burn phases"
- *Stacking issues:* Envenomed Blades, Scream, lifetap may conflict—tenable loss at endgame numbers; attack alone is huge bonus

### White Damage Build (Experimental)

- **Rogue → Bard → Cleric → Warrior** – Tasty testing; 800 ATK buff from Bard; still testing stacking

---

## Essential Augs & Gear (RB0 / Pre-Rebirth)

### Must-Have

- **Gem of Scream of Death**
- **Lifetap procs for weapons** – Super needed for self-healing (especially without SK)
- **Undead poison** – PoK poison vendor; good but not enough on its own

### VP / Endgame

- **Ward of Mysaphar** – Stuns trash, lets you get rear backstabs
- **Dodge gem**
- **Tremor gem** – Strong proc option

### Gear Sources

- MMM boss class gear—buy from bazaar if you can't kill yet; low rarity often cheap
- Kill giant in NK once daily for legendary chances

---

## Epic

### 1.0

- **Vilnius the Small** – Spawns on hill by tree; kill PH sometimes; can spawn middle of day (not just 12pm)
- **Stanos** – Can't spawn until level 50
- Start around 40; pickpocket requirements vary

### 1.5

- **Don't do the 1.5 quest** – Set current epic to evolve and go kill
- **Robe of the Kedge** – Main bottleneck; Finny drops rarely; dark elves in Kithicor drop Ishva and Kedge robes (higher rate); Yendar Starpyre drops SMR; Robe of Oracle easy
- Robe and backbone most rare of the four pieces

---

## Survivability & VP

- SK not necessary for VP 3; "decent augs/weapons and pushing buttons" enough
- Can kill VP 3 bosses without Combat Agility
- Backstab damage is attack-reliant; large variance from AC on rebirth mobs
- 6–800k rounds possible with no discs
- PD fight: buffed adds reverse-summoning behind you can one-shot

---

## Pre-Rebirth Strategy (RB0)

- Mass pulls at RB0 may not be the goal
- Work on epic and prepare to rebirth
- Rebirth Crushbone, BB, Unrest doable with not-great gear
- Save enough scrolls to complete next rebirth before doing it; gear less important than scrolls

---

## Wizard Rebirth Notes

- Wiz familiar works with all poison procs; all poisons crit
- Heal disc when attacking—other taps eclipse it but not negligible; does crit heal with Wiz
