## Build Paths

### Proc / AoE Build

- **Warrior → Wizard** – Kerafyrm familiar adds major proc damage; "8k AoE crits non-stop" with Tremor, Word of Shadow/Pain, AoE augs
- Pull large groups and AoE them down quickly
- **Warrior → Wizard → SK** – SK doubles down on tap damage; single-target set with Vampiric Strike + tap augs; "virtually never die"
- **Warrior → SK → Wizard** – Also strong; "SK defensive proc lifetap is nutty with wiz"

### White Damage Build

- **Warrior → Ranger → SK → Berserker** – 28k max crit without burning
- **Warrior → Monk → Ranger → Berserker** – Big white damage; sustain via heal proc augs and spell damage/heal
- **Warrior → Ranger → Enchanter → Wizard** – "Arcane offensive dual-wielding" theme; enchanter brings defensives (dopples, runes, lifetap proc on group haste)

## Rebirth Order Options

| Build Type | Order | Notes |
|------------|-------|-------|
| Proc/AoE | War → Wiz → SK → (Ranger or BST) | Wizard first for crit procs on AoE augs |
| Proc/AoE | War → SK → Wiz → (Zerker or Ranger) | SK lifetap + Wiz crit; "slaps" |
| White damage | War → Ranger → SK → Berserker | Focus on crits |
| White damage | War → Monk → Ranger → Berserker | Heal proc aug for sustain |
| Hybrid | War → Ranger → Enchanter → Wizard | Defensives + proc damage |

**4th rebirth:** Berserker or Ranger both popular; "zerker just gets so many nice passive dps aa"

## Which AAs to Get First

### Step-by-Step Order

1. **Proc AAs** – Priority for proc/AoE builds; major impact every level/rebirth
2. **Double Attack AAs** – Core DPS for all builds
3. **Triple Attack AAs** – Core DPS for all builds
4. **Defensive AAs** (Combat Agility, Combat Stability, etc.) – 10–20 ranks is cheap and effective; mostly for endgame content

*Focus on proc, double attack, and triple attack AAs every time you level or rebirth.*

## Warrior Discs / Tomes

- **Combat Proficiency** – Grab the **level 20 tome**; "makes your life way easier." Don't get the AA version; the tome overrides it.
- **Whorl Blade** (Mansion) – Replaced by Whirlwind Blade later; not a priority
- **Ward of Viciousness** – Castle
- Beast Domain and Castle have warrior-specific discs/tomes

---

## General Tips

- **Alt epic** – "The click is absolutely insane"; do it
- **Rebirth VP** – Much harder than normal VP; nameds flurry for ~5k with 70 shielding
- **Sustain** – Heal proc aug + spell damage/heal works for builds without Paladin/SK
- **Crafting** – You can proc legendary from crafting, but farming enhanced drops while exping is usually better early on
- **Boxing** – Not recommended; server has issues with it, and scroll AAs make it rough
